## Introduction

Zoozle is my personal project, a playful Google Clone built with passion and excitement using React, Material-UI (Mui), and the magic of React hooks like useContext and useReducer. It offers an immersive search experience with real-time results, pagination buttons, and an image page displaying captivating visuals related to your search.
